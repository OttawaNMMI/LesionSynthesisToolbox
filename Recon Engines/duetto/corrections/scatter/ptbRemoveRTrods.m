% Identify and remove RT table rods. The area of the RT table rod is [23, 45]
% in pixel units (when muImg is recontructed on the default 70 cm FOV) and
% is present in all slices.
% Note: This RT removal algorithm was originally written with the 3D
% "bwlabeln" function. It was modified for 2D to facilitate product code
% implementation.
