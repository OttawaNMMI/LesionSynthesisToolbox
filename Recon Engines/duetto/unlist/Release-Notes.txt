Unlist related release notes.

2016-05-19:
- Resolved TOF sinogram getTimeBin() issue. Sign of deltaTime must be flipped
  when view is < pi/2 or > 3/2pi.
- Added UnlistMain.m optional maxTableLocDiff rx parameter that is used to
  find the DICOM header file with the correct table_z_location.

2016-04-07:
- Resolved special case file naming issue with gated unlist of a single gated bin of a multi-bed scan. 
  In this Q-Static like case, the SINO file name corresponds to the bed loc index.
- Added UnlistMain.m optional forceVqcAdjust parameter to allow unlisting when the DICOM header
  file table_z_location does not account for vqc_z_axis_trans.

2016-01-12:
- Replaced use of datetime() function with datenum().

2015-12-03:
- Updated UnlistMain() to support a relative list file path.

2015-11-10:
- Added support for unlisting scans with MRAC data.
- Created pet-dicom-dict-ext.txt file (an extended version of pet-dicom-dict.txt) that contains all
  private MRPET related attributes.

2015-10-28:
- Added support for multi-bed scans unlisted to a single directory with support for multi-bed image recon.
- Improved matching of SINO and DICOM files with product.
- Unlist directories of the form 'unlist-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS/' contain a 'unlistRx-bed<n>' text file
  for each bed position.
- Added support for gated single phase percent binning mode (SPPB).
- Added check for more than one DICOM header file with matching tableZpos.
- The autotest/bin/autotestEnv.sh script is only auto-created if it does not already exist.
- Various esthetic improvements to progress messages, comments, README (Getting started section), etc.

2015-10-19:
- Added dicom2txt.m and sino2txt.m utility functions.
- Resolved issue related to VQC table offset for feet first scans so maxTableLocDiff (tolerance) is back to 2.0mm.
- The startMsecVec and endMsecVec parameters may end a frame using '-1' or a number that exceeds time markers in 
  the list file.
- Improved startMsecVec and endMsecVec logic and diagnostic messages.

2015-10-09:
- Added cell overflow check for both 1 and 2 bytes per cell histograms.
- Updated maxTableLocDiff (tolerance) from 2.0mm to 5.0mm.

2015-10-07:
- Resolved bug in PtbUnlist.cpp related to intermittent "Duplicates found!" error.
- UnlistMain.m API change:
  a) support optional rx.gatedWaitForFirstTrig parameter. Previously, this was called rx.gatedTrigType.
  b) rx.gatedFrameMsecs is now optional.
- Improved logic and diagnostic display related to finding the correct DICOM header file.
- Added support for static and dynamic unlist of live gated list file. Previously, this did not work.
- Added unlist automated test capability and framework.

2015-09-23:
- Added support for gated 'time', 'percent', and 'bypass' binning.
- Added support for gated trigger rejection (min/max only, not same as product).
- Added support for multi-bed (each bed resides in a separate directory, multi-bed image recon is not supported).
- Added support for setting (1 or 2) bytesPerCell at run-time.
- Optionally, generate a text result file for use by autotest.

2015-09-03:
