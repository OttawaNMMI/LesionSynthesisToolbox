A compressed archive file exists external to the source control system that contains the binary files required to run unlist autotest.

The archive file is named: petrecon-unlist-autotest-<YYYY-MM-DD.tgz>

Typical steps to run autotest:
1) find and unarchive the .tgz file noted above (e.g. tar xzvf petrecon-unlist-autotest*.tgz)

2) In matlab, run "autoUnlistAll <dirPath>" where dirPath is the directory where the .tgz was unarchived.

3) If all test cases do not pass, review the ".diff" files contained in "<dirPath>/result-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS/".

4) If needed update "filter.sed" to account for differences and rerun "bin/diffGold.sh" to review differences again.
   A zero-length ".diff" file indicates no differences with the corresponding file in "gold-results/".
