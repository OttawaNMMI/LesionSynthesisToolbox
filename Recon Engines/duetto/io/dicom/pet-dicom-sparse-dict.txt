# Filename: pet-dicom-dict.txt
#
# This is a DICOM dictionary designed and supported by the PET Toolbox project
# to read PET DICOM files in MATLAB.  It has been designed (and tested) to be
# effective for the purposes of its users to date; it is NOT warranted to be
# an accurate or complete representation of the DICOM conformance document for
# any particular GE scanner.
#
# Note that this file is different from the CT dictionary (ct-dicom-dict.txt)
# because there are certain attributes that are defined differently in the GE
# DICOM implementations for these two modalities.
#
# Please report corrections and/or additions:
#  GE Employees: Use the "Bug Tracking" feature of the pettoolbox project
#                    in OpenGE.
#  Outside researchers: Contact the GE employee who distributed this file
#                    to you.
#
# To parse the contents of this data dictionary in Matlab, execute:
#
# [group,element,VR,attributeName,VM] = textread('ct-dicom-dict.txt',...
#                                      '(%4c,%4c)\t%s%s%s',...
#                                      'commentstyle','shell',...
#                                      'delimiter','\t');
