function  outpict=imblend(FG,BG,opacity,blendmode,varargin)
%   IMBLEND(FG, BG, OPACITY, BLENDMODE,{AMOUNT},{COMPMODE},{CAMOUNT},{OPTIONS})
%       Blend images or imagesets as one would blend layers in GIMP, Krita, or Photoshop. 
%
%   FG, BG are image arrays of same H,V dimension
%       Mismatches of dimensions 1:2 are not supported. Use IMSTACKER, IMRESIZE,  
%           IMCROP, or PADARRAY to enforce desired colocation of layer content.
%       Mismatches of dimension 3 are handled by array expansion.  
%           1 or 3 channel images are assumed to be monochrome or RGB, respectively
%           2 or 4 channel images are assumed to have an added alpha channel
%           blending a RGB image and a monochrome image results in an RGB image
%           blending a I/RGB image with a IA/RGBA image results in an image with alpha
%       Mismatches of dimension 4 are handled by array expansion.
%           both can be single images or 4-D imagesets of equal length
%           can also blend a single image with a 4-D imageset
%   OPACITY is a scalar from 0 to 1
%       defines mixing of blended result and original BG
%   BLENDMODE is a string assignment (see list & notes) 
%       this parameter is insensitive to case and spacing
%       see included <a href="matlab: web(fullfile(fileparts(which('imblend')),'contour_plots.pdf'))">contour plots</a> for insight into relationships and scaling behaviors
%   AMOUNT is a numeric parameter (optional, default 1)
%       used to internally scale the influence of blend calculations
%       modes which accept this argument are marked with effective range
%   COMPMODE optionally specifies the compositing or alpha blending used for images. (see list)
%       default behavior replicates legacy GIMP behavior
%   CAMOUNT is a thresholding parameter used by some compositing modes (optional, default 1)
%
%   OPTIONS may include the following keys:
%   The user may optionally specify the standard used for luma or YPbPr calculations.
%       This only affects modes which perform Y or YPbPr conversion within the scope of IMBLEND.
%       'rec601' (default) or 'rec709' are valid keys.
%   For niche application, a polar color model can be selected with the 'hsy' or 'ypbpr' keys.
%       Both modes enforce gamut extents via chroma normalization (hsy) or truncation (ypbpr).
%   Specifying 'quiet' will suppress non-terminal warnings
%   Specifying 'verbose' will dump extra information relevant for some modes

%       'hardmixps' is referred to as 'hardmix' in older imblend versions
%       'mod', 'modshift', and 'moddivide' are referred to as 'modulo', 'modulo shift', and 'divisive modulo' in Krita
%       continuized modulo modes are 'modulo continuous', 'modulo shift continuous', and 'divisive modulo continuous'
%       Either name may be used.
%
%       COMBINED DIRECTIONAL MODES:
%       Several of the contrast-type modes can be thought of as bidirectional combinations of familiar unidirectional
%       mode pairs such as dodges and burns.  This relationship should help with understanding how and when to use  
%       them. The difference to keep in mind is a shift in the neutral color (to FG=0.5), and a doubling of dR/dFG.
%           'hard light' is a combination of 'screen' and 'multiply'
%           'vivid light' is a combination of 'colordodge' and 'colorburn'
%           'linear light' is a combination of 'lineardodge' and 'linearburn'
%           'easy light' is a combination of 'easydodge' and 'easyburn'
%           'pin light' is a combination of 'lightenrgb' and 'darkenrgb'
%       
%       SOFT LIGHT:
%       The assumed goal of these modes is to behave as a gamma adjustment function symmetric about FG=0.5. 
%       Roughly speaking, these are listed from fastest to most mathematically correct.
%       'softlight' is equivalent to ImageMagick, GIMP, and GEGL code.  Also known as 'pegtop light'.
%             This mode has gradient continuity, but poor symmetry.
%       'softlightps' is equivalent to all formulae found attributed to Photoshop (afaik). 
%       'softlightsvg' follows SVG 1.2 spec, and is nearly identical to 'softlightps'.
%             These modes have notable gradient discontinuity, but better symmetry.
%       'softlighteb' uses the faster of the two methods posed for EffectBank by illusions.hu
%             This mode has gradient continuity and only slight asymmetry, but it's ~2x as fast as 'eb2'.
%       'softlighteb2' is a parametric extension of the most accurate method posed for EffectBank
%             This mode has gradient continuity and symmetry for all parameter values.
%             In this mode, FG=[0 1] maps to gamma=[2^amount 1/(2^amount)].
%       See <a href="matlab: web(fullfile(fileparts(which('imblend')),'contour_plots.pdf'))">contour plot pdf</a> for exploration of symmetry, relative speed, and gradient discontinuity.
%
%       OVERLAY & HARDLIGHT MODES:
%       For AMOUNT=1, these behave as per standard formulae. Otherwise, an alternative is used.
%       These are custom mesh modes which approximate iterated application of the named blend
%       in a fashion which is continuously scalable so as to simulate fractional iterates.
%       Consider the following examples using 'overlay'
%           For AMOUNT=0.7, results approximate a softlight blend
%           For AMOUNT=1, results are identical to standard methods
%           For AMOUNT=2, results approximate IMBLEND(FG,IMBLEND(FG,BG,1,'overlay'),1,'overlay')
%
%       FLAT LIGHT & VARIANTS:
%       The original 'flatlight' is a piecewise combination of 'softdodge' & 'softburn'.  The effect is 
%       flat and somewhat opaque, tending to superimpose FG extrema.  The result is a middle ground between 
%       the behaviors and utility of 'vividlight' and 'pinlight'.  
%
%       'softflatlight' is a piecewise combination of 'softdodge2' & 'softburn2'.  While otherwise very similar 
%       to 'flatlight', this trig-based variant trades the strictly neutral response at FG=0.5 for a more 
%       subtle response along the FG=BG diagonal.  See <a href="matlab: web(fullfile(fileparts(which('imblend')),'contour_plots.pdf'))">contour plots</a>.
%
%       'softerflatlight' is a piecewise combination of 'softdodge3' & 'softburn3'.  Much like 'softflatlight', 
%       the neutral response is sacrificed to a greater degree. The result has a linear response parallel to the 
%       FG=BG diagonal for AMOUNT=1. Of the three, this tends to be the softest or "flattest".
%
%       MEAN LIGHT & VARIANTS:
%       'meanlight' is a piecewise combination of 'softdodge' & 'softburn'.  While the response for FG=0.5 is 
%       neutral, the response for FG=0 and FG=1 is mean(FG,BG).  The result is generally very flat and opaque.  
%       Unlike 'flatlight' modes (and most "light" modes), 'meanlight' modes have no gradient discontinuity.
%
%       Like 'softerflatlight', 'softmeanlight' is a combination of 'softdodge3' & 'softburn3', with the same 
%       tradeoff. The neutral response is about FG=BG instead of FG=0.5, and the result is softer than 'meanlight'.
%
%       PIN LIGHT:
%       This mode combines lighten-only and darken-only thresholding to allow incorporation of FG
%       extrema into the BG image.  As AMOUNT is decreased, the thresholding becomes more exclusive.
%
%       SUPER LIGHT:
%       Piecewise union of functions whose level curves are superelliptic.  Allows transition between
%       behaviors of other blend modes. Useful in place of 'pin light' if a soft threshold is desired.
%           For AMOUNT=1, behavior matches 'linear light'
%           For AMOUNT=2, behavior is similar to 'hard light'
%           For AMOUNT>>2, behavior approaches 'pin light'
%
%       MEAN-CENTERED CONTRAST MODES:
%       The modes 'scale add', 'scale mult', and 'contrast' are intended for uses similar to those of GIMP's
%       'grain merge' mode.  In normal operation, the FG content is treated as a mean-centered gain map for
%       the blend effect in question.  As an alternative to mean-centering, the center color may be specified
%       via AMOUNT in the form of [k cc], where k is the scaling factor and cc is the center color, which may
%       be either 1 or 3 elements;  i.e. [1 0.5] is equivalent to [1 0.5 0.5 0.5].  In this fashion, 'scale add'
%       and 'scale mult' effect adjustable additive and multiplicative gain mapping.  'contrast' acts as a 
%       levels tool, shifting the BG input white point or black point depending on FG value. This mode is
%       similar to a subtle application of 'vivid light', with its breakpoints controlled by the center color.
%       When cc=0 or 1, 'contrast' becomes equivalent to 'color dodge' or 'color burn'.  
%
%       CURVES:
%       This mode allows direct manipulation of BG contrast in a fashion similar to that of a curves tool.
%       This mode can take up to three parameters via AMOUNT.  A full specification is of the form [k os gp],
%       where k is a scaling factor, os is an offset (default 0), and gp is the input grey value (default 0.5).
%       The amount of curvature is modulated following C=(k*FG + os), and the midpoint of the curve is shifted 
%       by gp.  Setting k=0 allows scalar manipulation of contrast without the necessity for a solid FG fill.
%           When C>1, BG contrast is increased
%           When 0<C<1, BG contrast is decreased.
%           When C=0, BG = 0.5.
%           When C<0, BG is inverted, with contrast following abs(C)
%       With that in mind, AMOUNT=[0 1 0.5] is the null condition, and results in no change to the BG
%    
%       SOFT DODGE & BURN VARIANTS:
%       Jens Gruschel's original formulae are a combination of 'colordodge' and inverse 'colorburn';  
%       the pair are simple transposes, unlike the other dodge/burn modes.  When parameterized, 
%       their relationship follows imblend(FG,BG,1,'softdodge',k) = imblend(BG,FG,'softburn',1/k).  
%       In other words, either can function as dodge or burn depending on intended layer order.  
%       For AMOUNT>1, BG content remains dominant; for AMOUNT<1, FG content dominates.  
%       See <a href="matlab: web(fullfile(fileparts(which('imblend')),'contour_plots.pdf'))">contour plots</a> for insight.  These modes have no neutral FG color.
%       These modes have a linear response along the FG=0 and BG=1 edges.
%
%       The second variants are very similar to the original modes, with the same lack of a neutral response.
%       Similar to 'softflatlight', these are trig-based variants with only subtle slope differences. 
%       Mathematically, 'softdodge2' is equivalent to 'arctan' with an inverted FG; 'softburn2' is the transpose.
%       These modes do not have a linear response along any linear locus.
%
%       The third variants are again very similar, but are designed specifically to have a linear response along 
%       the FG=BG diagonal.  This results in an even softer or flatter appearance in typical use cases.
%
%       EASY DODGE & BURN:
%       These are modified power functions allowing scalable dodge/burn functionality without destroying
%       highlight and shadow details.  As traditional methods are constant-valued for 50% of their
%       domain, they tend to exhibit a thresholding behavior.  While 'easydodge' and Gruschel's 'softdodge'
%       can both darken and lighten, 'easydodge' is more asymmetric and has only subtle darkening effect.
%       Unlike 'color' or 'linear' dodge & burn, the neutral FG color for the 'easy' modes is not black/white, 
%       but 1/6 and 5/6 (for AMOUNT=1). Results from 'easydodge' tend to be soft and less-oversaturated,  
%       as if a compromise between 'colordodge' and 'screen'.  These are good all-around tools for dodge/burn  
%       tasks where extra contrast stretching is desired, or where a continuous gradient is desired. 
%
%       GAMMA DODGE & BURN:
%       These are mathematically related to the 'easy' dodge/burn modes, though they are not as tailored
%       for general dodge/burn use.  They tend to be harder than the 'easy' modes, but softer than 'glow' and 'heat'.
%       As pairs, 'gammadodge' and 'gammaburn' conceptually address different goals than 'gammalight' and 'gammadark'.  
%       Neutral response occurs at black and white, as is common to the 'linear' and 'color' dodge/burn modes.
%       For unity AMOUNT, 'gammaburn' and 'gammadark' are equivalent.
%
%       QUADRATIC MODES:
%       'glow' and 'heat' are higher-ordered variants of 'colordodge' and 'colorburn'. Compared to the  
%       latter, they have subdued effect for default AMOUNT, though they are largely constant-valued 
%       and exhibit the same thresholding behavior.  While both color and linear dodge/burn are unidirectional, 
%       these modes can both lighten and darken an image. The complementary modes 'gleat' and 'helow' are 
%       symmetric modes derived from the prior.  'gleat' behaves similar to 'vividlight', whereas 'helow' 
%       is similar to 'overlay' but with the midtone contrast response inverted (see <a href="matlab: web(fullfile(fileparts(which('imblend')),'contour_plots.pdf'))">contour plots</a>).
%       'helow' and its transpose do not exhibit thresholding.
%
%       LIGHTEN & DARKEN: 
%       The RGB modes are simple max/min relationals, much like GIMP's 'lighten only' and 'darken only'.
%       The hard edge of these RGB modes can be tempered by specifying a range of smooth transition.  
%       For AMOUNT=1, the operation is simple relational. Otherwise, AMOUNT specifies the width of the 
%       transition region about the unit square diagonal (in percent).  When AMOUNT=100, no unaltered FG
%       or BG content remains; a value of 10% or so helps reduce the appearance of transition edges.
%
%       'lighteny' and 'darkeny' are similar to Photoshop's 'lighter color' and 'darker color' modes. 
%       Here, the FG/BG pixel luma is evaluated and the pixels replaced as a whole instead of evaluating 
%       each channel. This results in a binary masking behavior when AMOUNT=1. Otherwise, the transition
%       between FG and BG is a linearized opacity blend.  This is a tentative measure to reduce perceived
%       brightness inversions or banding which otherwise occur in the blended region.
%
%       DISTANCE MODES:
%       The modes 'near' and 'far' locate regions in which FG and BG colors are within or beyond a weighted
%       euclidean distance.  Both modes accept an optional argument {layer} which may be 'fg' or 'bg'.
%           'near fg' will return only the FG content in the match region
%           'near bg' will return only the BG content in the match region
%           'near' merges matching FG content into BG
%       For RGB inputs, distance calculation is performed in YPbPr, with extra weighting on luma.
%       For distance specified by AMOUNT>=1, all colors are considered 'near'.
%
%       REPLACE & EXCLUDE COLOR:
%       These incorporate simple masking behavior which allows the user to handle composition with
%       solid-color image matting.  For example, if AMOUNT=[0 0 0], 'replacecolor' copies FG data  
%       to all black BG regions; 'excludecolor' copies all non-black FG content to the BG.  
%       If AMOUNT is a scalar, it will be expanded as necessary. Masking has a tolerance of 1%
%
%       SATURATE & DESATURATE:
%       Unlike the component mode 'saturation', these are thresholding modes operating on chroma 
%       in LCHab, much like 'lightenrgb' or 'lighteny' operates on rgb channels and luma. In these
%       modes, AMOUNT modulates foreground chroma.
%
%       COSINE INTERPOLATION:
%       'interpolate' does cosine interpolation from FG to BG.  The parameterization allows for iterative
%       behavior, replicating the behavior of Krita's 'interpolate 2' for AMOUNT=2, and generally
%       increasing the contrast with each iteration.  Results rapidly approach 'hardmixps' as AMOUNT is increased.
%       Conceptually, interpolate(FG,BG,2) = interpolate(interpolate(FG,BG,1),interpolate(FG,BG,1),1).
%       Fractional iterations are unsupported.
%
%       'hardint' is a quantized version of 'interpolate'.  AMOUNT controls the number of quantization levels.
%
%       KRITA & EFFECTBANK/ILLUSIONS.HU MODES:
%       'tint' and 'shade' are strong dodge/burn-like modes
%       'light' and 'shadow' are the transposes of 'tint' and 'shade'
%       'bright' and 'dark' are soft, partially inverting dodge/burn-like modes
%       'lighteneb' and 'darkeneb' are similar to a strong, transposed softdodge/burn
%       'bleach' and 'stain' are the inverse of 'lineardodge' (addition), and 'linearburn'
%       'sqrtdiff', aka 'additivesubtractive' is the difference of square roots
%       'harmonic', aka 'parallel' is the harmonic mean; roughly equivalent to 'geometric'
%       'arctan' is similar to 'softdodge' with an inverted FG
%       'hardoverlay' is a combination of 'multiply' and 'divide', more related to 'hardlight' than 'overlay'
%       'gammalight' and 'gammadark' allow gamma adjustment with AMOUNTxFG as a gamma map.
%
%       HARD MIX MODES:
%       'hardmixps' simply performs a thresholding along the (FG+BG)=1 diagonal.  For nonunity AMOUNT, the locus 
%           of this threshold shifts along the FG=BG diagonal.  In this manner, AMOUNT varies the brightness of 
%           the output, while the relative influence of FG versus BG remains equal.
%       'hardmixib' is a linearizing variant of 'hardmixps', and is equivalent for unity AMOUNT.  As AMOUNT is 
%           varied over [0 2], the function behavior blends from 'grainmerge' to 'meanlight'. In other words, 
%           AMOUNT varies the hardness of the thresholding, softening as AMOUNT deviates to either side of unity.
%       'hardmixkr' is a piecewise combination of 'colordodge' and 'colorburn', split along BG=0.5. The effect is
%           softer near FG extrema than a simple BG=0.5 thresholding would otherwise be. As AMOUNT is varied 
%           over [0 2], the function behavior nonlinearly blends from 'grainmerge' to a simple BG=0.5 thresholding.  
%           In other words, AMOUNT varies the hardness of the thresholding, becoming maximally hard at AMOUNT=2.
%
%       MESH MODES:
%       These modes accept AMOUNT in the form of a 2x2 or larger matrix whose elements represent
%       output intensity for input intensities from 0 to 1 (consider BG as horizontal axis, etc)
%       e.g [0 0.5; 0.5 1] is equivalent to 'average'; [0 0; 1 1] is the same as 'normal'
%       Compare to the included <a href="matlab: web(fullfile(fileparts(which('imblend')),'contour_plots.pdf'))">contour plots</a>; amount(1,1) is at the origin of BG and FG axes.
%       Values are assumed to be evenly spaced and are subject to interpolation (bilinear for 'mesh' 
%       and nearest-neighbor for 'hardmesh'). If AMOUNT is not set explicitly to a valid matrix, 
%       a warning will be dumped and a default used.
%
%       RANDOMIZED MODES:
%       These are all mesh modes based on a random transfer function matrix of user-defined size.
%       For scalar AMOUNT, the tf matrix is of size (AMOUNT+1)x(AMOUNT+1).
%       When AMOUNT is a 2-element vector, the tf matrix is (AMOUNT(1)+1)x(AMOUNT(2)+1).
%       The 'bomb' mode applies a random piecewise-linear mesh blend
%       The 'bomblocked' mode is the same as 'bomb', but without channel-independence
%       The 'hardbomb' mode applies a random piecewise-constant mesh blend
%       Using the 'verbose' key with these modes will display the transformation matrix as a command string.
%       These can then be used with the mesh modes to reproduce a particular random blend.  
%		
%       COLOR MODES: 
%       'color' is a variant of the HSL method with an attempt to enforce luma preservation (fast)
%       'color hsyp' attempts to provide best uniformity, at the cost of maximum chroma range.
%       'color hsl' matches the legacy 'color' blend mode in GIMP
%        Based only on experiment, LCHab method best approximates Photoshop behavior.
%
%       The 'hue' & 'saturation' modes are derived from LCHab instead of HSL as in GIMP.
%       If H or S modes are desired in HuSL, HSY, HSI or HSV, use 'transfer' instead.
%
%       TRANSFER MODES:
%       mode accepts channel strings based on RGBA, HuSLuv, HSY, HSYp, HSI, HSL, HSV, or CIELCHab models
%           'y', 'r', 'g', 'b', 'a'
%           'h_husl', 's_husl', 'l_husl'
%           'h_hsy', 's_hsy', 'y_hsy'
%           'h_hsyp', 's_hsyp', 'y_hsyp'
%           'h_hsi', 's_hsi', 'i_hsi'
%           'h_hsl', 's_hsl', 'l_hsl'
%           'h_hsv', 's_hsv', 'v_hsv'
%           'l_lch', 'c_lch', 'h_lch'
%       non-rgb symmetric channel transfers (e.g. V>V or Y>Y) are easier applied otherwise
%           (e.g. 'value' or 'luma' blend modes)
%  
%       PERMUTATION MODES:
%       modes can accept input channel strings 'h', 's', 'y', 'dh', 'ds', 'dy'
%       permutations actually occur on H and S in the HuSLuv model
%       color permutations (inchan>HS) combine hue rotation and chroma blending
%       chroma blending is maximized when abs(amount)==1
% 
%       RECOLOR MODES:
%       These modes use histogram matching to apply FG color information to the BG image without transferring any 
%       object content from the FG.  In other words, the BG is unsubtly forced to inherit a color "theme" from 
%       the FG.   See IMRECOLOR for details.  Operations can be done in LCHuv or in luma-corrected HSL (faster).  
%       Option substrings include the channel specification 'h','s', or 'hs'.  The behavior can be transposed by 
%       adding 'tp' to the option substring (e.g. 'recolorhsly tp hs').   By default, these modes incorporate a blur 
%       operation in order to reduce speckling with some image combinations. AMOUNT may be a 2-element vector, where 
%       AMOUNT(1)*16 is the number of lightness bins, and where AMOUNT(2) is the despeckling blur size (default 5px).  
%       This blur can be disabled by setting blursize to 1px.  These modes require imhistmatch (from IP Toolbox) to work.  
%
%       BLURMAP MODES:
%       These are naive multipass opacity blended blur operations; no actual map analysis or segmentation is performed.  
%       The focal distance corresponds to FG=0; maximum blur occurs at FG=1, with max kernel size specified by AMOUNT 
%       (default 20px) 'blurmap' uses a gaussian kernel. 'blurmapring' uses a simple ring kernel and may be better at 
%       distracting from the artifacts of the opacity blending if BG contains salient edge features. 
%       These modes require imfilter (from IP Toolbox) to work.

%   
%   NOTES:
%       Some of these modes (e.g. 'dst in', 'xor') don't really make much sense to use with
%       any blend mode other than 'normal'.  You're not restricted from doing it, though.
%       
%       'gimp' specifies the legacy approach used by GIMP prior to GEGL (default)
%       This is similar to SRC-OVER composition for 'normal' and a modified SRC-ATOP 
%       composition for other blends
%
%       The SVG 1.2 spec and GEGL follow a Porter-Duff SRC-OVER composition for all blends
%
%       PORTER-DUFF MODES:
%       If using these modes where hard-edged masking behavior is desired, specifying a nonunity CAMOUNT 
%       will invoke a thresholding operation on the FG alpha channel.  
%           CAMOUNT>1 sets all alpha <1 to 0
%           CAMOUNT in the interval (0,1) thresholds alpha at the specified value
%           CAMOUNT=0 will set all nonzero alpha to 1
%       Unlike other modes, using these on I/RGB inputs may force IA/RGBA output depending on the mode
%       and the value of specified OPACITY.  These are generally not useful cases.
%
%       TRANSLUCENT MODE:
%       This mode is based on an article by Søren Sandmann Pedersen, and uses a transmission-reflection
%       model to emulate the effect of a translucent material. Calculations are performed in linear RGB.
%
%       DISSOLVE MODES:   
%       These modes are essentially SRC-OVER composition after FG alpha is converted to a dithered
%       binary mask using one of the following methods:
%           'dissolve' applies a white noise thresholding dither (GIMP behavior)
%           'dissolve ord' applies a 64-level ordered dither
%           'dissolve zf' applies a Zhou-Fang variable-coefficient E-D dither (best)
%       When using these modes, final mixdown opacity is linearly scaled with OPACITY as usual.
%       The masking density is controlled via CAMOUNT. The combination of dithering and linear opacity
%       makes the creation of texture or grain overlays very simple.
%
%       The 'lindissolve' modes offer the same methods, but the dithering is performed only on a uniform 
%       mask.  This leaves linear FG alpha intact, allowing for a different range of control. i.e.:
%           In 'dissolve', opacity is scalar (OPACITY) and density is a map (alpha*CAMOUNT)
%           In 'lindissolve', opacity is a map (alpha*OPACITY) and density is scalar (CAMOUNT)
%       When no FG alpha channel is present, 'dissolve' and 'lindissolve' are identical.
%
