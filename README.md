# LesionSynthesisToolbox
A toolbox for synthesizing artificial lesions into PET and CT data.

The Lesion Synthesis Tooldbox (LST) is an open source Matlab webapp that can be run in Matlab, deployed as a standalone executable, or hosted as a web application. 

LST is designed to enable researchers to insert well characterized lesions into PET and CT data:
- In PET, the lesions are forward projected into the raw data and are then reconstructed. In our work we used the DUETTO toolbox from GE Halthcare, which requires a research agreement. Reach out to Elizabeth Philps (Elizabeth.Philps@med.ge.com) to obtain access. We are happy to support other vendors. Please reach out to collaborate.
- In CT, the lesion values are written directly into the CT image.

## Getting started
To run the LesionSynthesisToolbox.mlapp which launches the main user interface.
